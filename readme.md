# AskMe

AskMe was originally built as a platform for DeRay Mckesson in his bid for Mayor of Baltimore in 2016. It was hosted at askderay.com throughtout the campaign and was used for him to interact with the community.

There were some aspirations to convert it into a more general platform called Soapbox, but that hasn't come to fruititon yet so Im making the source available here.
